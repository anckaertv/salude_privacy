    <h1>Salude Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Victor Anckaert built the Salude app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Victor Anckaert at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Salude unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as your email address and username associated with your account. You are then free to fill in information about bars or restaurants, including the name of the establishment, location, address, pictures, menu, price of drinks, and leave a rating.</p>
    <p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in the event of an error in the app, I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:</p>

    </ul>
  <p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
  <h2>Security</h2>

  <p>I value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, and I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
